Hi, I'm new to Rust, and this page showcases some of my tinkerings with it. 

## My Rust Projects

### [RandomNumberGenerator](https://github.com/coplat/rng)
A super simple program which generates a random number between two numbers of your choice. 

### [CatSay](https://github.com/coplat/CatSay/)
The feline Rust equivalent of cowsay. Also, my first ever program! 

### [SumSquared](https://github.com/coplat/SumSquared)
From Cassidoo's August 5th Newsletter: "Create a function that should take one argument n, which is a positive integer. The function should return the sum of all squared positive integers between 1 and n, inclusive."

### [Thyme](https://github.com/coplat/Thyme)
From Cassidoo's August 19th Newsletter: Given an array of function logs, where each log consists of a function name, a timestamp, and an event (either start or end), return the total execution time for each function. The timestamp is an integer representing milliseconds since the start of the program.

### [Stringies](https://github.com/coplat/Stringies)
From Cassidoo's August 26th Newsletter: "Given a string s containing letters and digits, return the longest substring of s where the number
of distinct letters is equal to the number of distinct digits. If there are multiple substrings with the same
length, return the one that appears first. (My solution also got an honorable mention!:))
